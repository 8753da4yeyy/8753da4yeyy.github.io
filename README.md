# Description of GitHub account: 
# My account is made for my assignment and it will be a place
# for future assignments to be submitted on.
#
#  The Steps I took to make the clone my repository was
# 1. Once my account was created, and on the dashboard, I clicked on the '+' on the top right of the screen
#    to create a new repository.
# 2. Once I created the repository and gave it a name. I downloaded the GitHub app to then clone the repository from the website
#    to my local drive by clicking on 'File' at the top right corner, then clicked on 'Clone Repository'.
# 3. Lastly after editing the 'README.md' I saved the file first, then clicked on 'Fetch Origin' to send the edited file back to the URL.
