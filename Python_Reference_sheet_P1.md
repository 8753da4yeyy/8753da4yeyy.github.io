Reference Sheet P1
07/30/2024

The purpose of this reference sheet is to re-edcuate myself and to educate others of how to properly
use data types, functions and classes. As well as other things Python allows the user to do. This file was created using the markdown
language and for the original .py file you may go to it here (https://github.com/8753da4yeyy/8753da4yeyy.github.io/blob/main/Python_Reference_sheet_P1.py "Python Reference Sheet)



To create a 'comment' for when you need to create a description for your code, we can use pound signs or triple-quotation marks.

```
# - pound sign creates single line comments in Python

''' - Triple quotation marks are used to create a paragraphed description of your code
'''
```
